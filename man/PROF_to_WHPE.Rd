\usage{
PROF_to_WHPE(
  file_path,
  path_out,
  userID = "IMASUTASKB",
  row_start = 1,
  row_end = NA,
  trace_file = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The path to the processing metadata file, titled "PROF_meta.csv".}

\item{path_out}{The path where reformatted files are to be sent. A subdirectory "profiling_sensors" will be created in here, if one does not already exist.}

\item{userID}{An ID code for the user creating the files.}

\item{row_start}{The start row of the processing metadata table, for batch run worflows.}

\item{row_end}{The end row of the processing metadata table, for batch run worflows.}

\item{trace_file}{TRUE will print out each file name as it is reformatted, FALSE suppresses this. It helps with de-bugging and identifying formatting errors during development.}
}
\value{
returns a successful run message and saves reformatted data to a "profiling_sensors" subdirectory in path_out.

\description{
BIOMATE reformats profiling sensor files and saves them as a file that is tagged by EXPOCODE, STATION and CAST. The resulting file follows WHP-Exchange format guidelines. Information is required from the user, stored within a user-entered metadata file particularly for batch runs, or provided via the BIOMATE submission app. The metadata file must be named "PROF_meta.csv". All PROF/CTD files must be singular per cast with the same extention, in one folder. Use the split_delim_file function to convert files to this format.
}
\note{
This function only supports well structured text delimited and NetCDF file formats.
