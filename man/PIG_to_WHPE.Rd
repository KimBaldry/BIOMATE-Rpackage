\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The path to the processing metadata file, titled "PIG_meta.csv".}

\item{path_out}{The path where reformatted files are to be sent. A subdirectory "pigments" will be created in here, if one does not already exist.}

\item{userID}{An ID code for the user creating the files.}

\item{row_start}{The start row of the processing metadata table, for batch run worflows.}

\item{row_end}{The end row of the processing metadata table, for batch run worflows.}
}
\value{
returns a successful run message and saves reformatted data to a "pigments" subdirectory in path_out.

\description{
BIOMATE reformats pigment files and saves them as a file that is tagged by EXPOCODE, METHOD and SOURCE. The resulting file follows WHP-Exchange format guidelines with the exception that MAREDAT pigment headers are used. Information is required from the user, stored within a user-entered metadata file particularly for batch runs, or provided via the BIOMATE submission app. The metadata file must be named "PIG_meta.csv". All pigment files must be split by EXPOCODE (can be multiple files in the same folder with identical extensions). Use the split_delim_file function to convert files if there are multiple voyages in a single file.
}
\note{
This function only supports well structured text delimited and NetCDF file formats.
